# CaReD CLI

A command line interface for managing a CaReD server.

CaReD stands for **Ca**talysis **Re**search **D**ata management.

It is a not-yet released web application to support researchers in catalysis doing their research more efficient while following the [FAIR](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18) principles.

Version 0.1 is mainly a project template. CaReD specific commands have not been added yet to this public repo.

The main development including the issue-tracking happens in a private intranet repository.
Therefore, the GitHub repository is mostly silent.

## Development

This project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv) for packaging and [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff) for consistent formatting.
